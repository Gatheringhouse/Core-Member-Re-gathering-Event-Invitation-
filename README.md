# Core-Member-Re-gathering-Event-Invitation-
Its been so long since our last catch-ups under the shadow of YES which we kicked off for our  youth dreams: capacity development, job opportunities, learning, all round development, so forth  and as gathering spot for the circle of our friends.  YES was already on the way to developed orgs with the enormous efforts put together through  our meetings and catch ups in both virtual and on ground. Unfortunately, the coup happened soon  after we had drafted our strategic plan and connection was poorly cut off since then due to  difficulties each member differently encountered.  Even what happened to Myanmar hit severely, YES passed through the prevailing storms with the  last straws we tied together to have moved forward.  Right now, the time come straight to reunion on the ground of YES with existing youth dreams and  duties the time put on our shoulder. Also, YES is now properly functioning the works adapted with  the situations. For further development, and returning to our org nature, we would like to craft regathering event as the agenda below.  We do hope you are joining us, in this re-gathering event. Just click here to join.  Meeting Agenda: Catch ups and latest updates, Core member regathering, Core Member and  Organizational Development
